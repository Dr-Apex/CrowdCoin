# CrowdCoin
> Decentralized App based on Ethereum Blockchain that resolves the issue with centralized systems (eg: kickstarter) developed using Web3.js, Next.js, Solidity, Infura and Mocha.

- The main benefit of moving to blockchain would be that no trust would be needed.
- Everything would be managed automatically with smart contracts still retaining a level of authority to sign off to ensure that the kickstarter projects being real.
- The platform can then be handed over to a DAO, which would allow the community to control it and ensure everything is always running smoothly.
