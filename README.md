# CrowdCoin
> Decentralized App based on Ethereum Blockchain that resolves the issue with centralized systems developed using Web3.js, Next.js and Solidity.
> The main benefit of moving to blockchain would be that no trust would be needed. 
> Everything would be managed automatically with smart contracts still retaining a level of authority to sign off to ensure that the kick starter projects being real.
> The platform can then be handed over to a DAO, which will allow the community to control it and ensure everything is always running smoothly.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
